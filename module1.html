<h1>Module 1</h1>

<p>Introduction <p>Hello.  I am Liz Brackeen. <p>  I am a consumer health librarian with the Patient Education department at MD Anderson Cancer Center.  I did my undergrad at Clark University in Worcester, Mass and my MS at UNT up in Denton. I was a guest lecturer and then adjunct faculty the UNT College of Information for the previous six years.  My partner Stephanie and I moved back to Houston from Utah in 2001. We have a 1 year old puppy named Sergio who is currently keeping us very busy.
