CUIN 7356
Mini-research proposal<p> 
Why is the study important? <p> 
This study is important because as online courses are becoming more heterogeneous, placing students into cohesive work groups can have a large impact on their creative expression during online group work. 
<p> 
Who are the subjects/participants of the proposed study? <p> 
Participants include two sections of a searching class made up of graduate students in Library and Information Science.
<p> 
What is the basic research question? <p> 
Does placing students into homogeneous work groups by self-identified “online homes” increase creativity or innovation in the final product of the work group when compared to randomly assigned groups. 
“Online home” would be the most common online communities that the individual student participates is. 

<p> 
Where would the study be conducted? <p> 
Within the LMS of the online course.
<p> 
What is the time frame for the study? <p> 
During the semester in which the course is offered.
<p> 
What type of data would be collected? <p> 
Online discussion transcripts of individual work groups would be coded by group for all negotiated and decided elements of the assignment.
The completed assignment and intra-group peer review will be coded for elements that indicate creative and innovative use of the chosen medium.
Something like the AACU Creative Thinking Value Rubric will be referenced for coding. <a href="http://www.aacu.org/value/rubrics/pdf/CreativeThinking.pdf">Link</a>

<p> 
How might the data be analyzed?<p> 
Data would be analyzed by comparative content analysis.
