<il>A description of group collaboration:</il>
    <p> Joshua kicked us off with an introductory email and Amber created a Google document where could collaborate. Synchronous communication via Skype was suggested by Betty but by the time we could find a meeting time that worked for everyone, we were well on our way to completing the project. We communicated primarily through 85 group email messages.  There were additional emails among individual group members as well as comments and chats within the google dcoument and the google presentation. Our ability to be an effective working group can be attributed to early agreement on a structure for our presentation and the willingness of each group member to do their part and more. Without this agreement and collegiality I do not think we would have had success using primarily asynchronous communication. </p>
<il>VoiceThread - positives and negatives:</il>
    <p>VoiceThread is very easy to use and after learning about Holmberg I appreciate the ability for asynchronous dialog. The negatives are the cluttered interface, small frame size and the discontinuity when there are many comments and comment formats on a particular slide, especially when you have a large number of potential commenters. </p>
<il>How VoiceThread could be used in my professional life:</il>
    <p>It would be very unlikely that I would use Voicethread in any part of my professional life.  Most of my colleagues do not have the ability to record or listen to audio at their desktop computers. I can see using it in a study of patient education material where patients would view a document or presentation however, due to patient privacy you would have to have an instance for each patient and that seems unweildy. Using VoiceThread with my students is more likely but I would limit it to a project where dialog is the end product of the assignment. </p>
