CUIN 7356
Mini-research proposal<p> 
The effect of consistent coaching and feedback on cognitive and technological presence in learner-led online workgroups.
<p>
Moderators of student-led online discussions in the experimental groups will receive coaching prior to and feedback immediately after moderating online discussion. 
<p> 
• Why is the study important? <p>
This study looks at the impact on higher order thinking of teaching presence in the form of consistent coaching and feedback with online learning in learner moderated chats.  This study also investigates whether there is any difference in the cognitive and/or technological presence of students when consistent coaching and feedback is given. It is important administratively because it has a direct correlation to the cost and quality of online education. It is also important to identify if and how teaching presence impacts a learners’ cognitive and technological presence. 
 <p>
• Who are the subjects/participants of the proposed study? <p>
The students will be two groups of College of Information graduate students currently enrolled in an online searching class. They will be randomly split into four small work groups, participants in two of the groups will receive consistent coaching and feedback and participants in the other two groups will receive the status quo, no coaching and minimal feedback.
<p>
• What is the basic research question? <p>
Q1. In a small online student moderated workgroup, does coaching and feedback for the moderator create higher order thinking for the group as a whole, compared to groups that do not receive coaching and feedback.
<p>
Q2. Do online students who receive consistent coaching and feedback display an increase in cognitive presence or technological presence?
<p>
• Where would the study be conducted? <p>
The study would be conducted via email, chat and within in a course within an LMS.
<p>
• What is the time frame for the study? <p>
The study would take place during the course of a semester-long course.
<p>
• What type of data would be collected? <p>
Data collected would be the clickstream and timing data from each student’s interactions with the course materials, the transcripts of the student-led discussions and the transcripts of the teacher and moderators’ coaching and feedback sessions.
<p>
• How might the data be analyzed?<p>
Data-mining methods would be used on the clickstream data and content analysis would be used on the transcripts.
<p>
• What study was the inspiration for this study?<p>
