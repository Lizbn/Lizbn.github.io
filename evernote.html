        <h1>CUIN 7376 Module 2 Tool Review</h1>
        <h2>Evernote</h2>
        
        
<ul>       
<li><a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a> a productivity and collaboration tool.</li>
<li><p> <img src="evernot.jpg" alt="evernote logo" style="float:left" width="205" height="54">
            is the App that walks into the room and shakes your hand while introducing himself and three minutes later you are writing a book chapter together with his new friend Moleskine <a href="https://evernote.com/partner/moleskine/">Moleskine</a>. Evernote is primarily a productivity tool but it is also very effective for collaboration. </p>
        
       
<li>If your collaborators or students are CritiqueIt users, it is a completely web-based tool once you upload your files. In fact one of the best features of this software is the ability to record audio or video within the browser and layer that as feedback to your student or collaborator.</li>
<li> The interface feels seemless once you are familiar with it but that familiartiy does not come right away. If you and/or your students are not familiar with the basic <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/mw/table/proofrea.htm">proofreading marks,</a> the <i>stamps</i> feature might not be as useful to you.</li>
<li>You do not have to have video or audio capabilites to use this product but they do enhance it's use. This software is not free, You have to purchase or request trial access. To get a trial you have to participate in a synchronous demo with a CritiquIt representative. This demo was easy to set up and even though I had watched each of the <a href=" http://edu.critiqueit.com/tutorials">tutorials</a>, I did learn quite a bit from the application demonstration.</li>
    
</ul>
<p>
    <ol>To use this product:
        <li>Get a logon.</l1>
        <li>Upload document(s)</li>
        <li>Critique or share and delegate Critiques</li>
    </ol></p>
<p>There are many more complex ways to use this software, but to start it really is as simple as uploading a document and selecting some text.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no example of a resource created with this tool but I do want to point out that the <a href=" https://eve.dwrl.utexas.edu/">UT Digital Writing and Research Lab</a> is using the enterprise version. </li>
<li>CritiqueIt could be used by any instructor that has to give handwritten or digital feedback on text documents, pdfs or Power Point files. The ease with which you can scroll through a pile of documents selecting and highlighting text while layering in the variety of types of feedback, makes this tool very appealing. The simple fact that you do not have to open each file speeds up the very time consuming process of reading and giving feedback on written work.</li>
<li>Ideally both teachers and students would have access to CritiqueIt. I imagine that it is cost prohibitive for the entire population in a seconday public school setting. Another thing to consider is that this is a feedback mechanism only, editing must take place elsewhere.  I see this as an advantge, requiring a bit more thought than just "accept change" in the editing process.</li>
<li>If you are giving feedback on a lot of written work and your institution or orgnization can afford it, there is no reason not to start using this tool right away. It was suggested during the demo that you can actually flip the usage and send your foreign language students a document and have them respond with an audio or video demonstrating their proficiency.</li>    </ol>
    </ul>
