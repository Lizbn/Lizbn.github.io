<ul>       
<li><a href="http://edu.critiqueit.com">CritigueIt</a> a communications tool.</li>
<li><p>
            CritqueIt is a web tool that can be used in a number of ways. It can be used with a group to collaboratively give feedback on a document or a set of documents. It can be used by an instructor or team to give feedback on students' work. Or, it could be used as a way to assign students work to which they need to respond. 
        </p>
        
        <p> CritiqueIt could be used in quite complex ways but it does not have to be, let's look at a demonstration of uploading a set of documents and critiquing one:
            
        </p>
        <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/hubnut/user/user28777713/uploaded_videos?color=44bbff&amp;background=000000&amp;slideshow=0&amp;video_title=1&amp;video_byline=1" width="400" height="300" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
        
<li>If your collaborators or students are CritiqueIt users, it is completely web-based once you upload your files. In fact one of the best features of this software is the ability to record audio or video within the browser and layer that as feedback to your student or collaborator.</li>
<li> The interface feels seemless once you are familiar with it but that familiartiy does not come right away. If you and/or your students are not familiar with the basic <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/mw/table/proofrea.htm">proofreading marks</a> the stamps feature might not be as useful to you.</li>
<li>You do not have to have video and audio capabilites to use this product but they do really enhance it's use. You also have to have access, this product is not free and to get a trial you have to participate in a synchronous demo with a CritiquIt representative. This demo was easy to set up and even though I had watched each of the <a href=" http://edu.critiqueit.com/tutorials">tutorials</a>, I did learn quite a bit from the application demonstration.</li>
    
</ol>
<p>
    <ol>To use this product:
        <li>Get a logon.</l1>
        <li>Upload document(s)</li>
        <li>Critique or share and delegate Critiques</li>
    </ol></p>
<p>There are many more complex ways to use this software, but to start it really is as simple as uploading a document and selecting some text.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no example of a resource created with this tool but I do want to point out that <a href=" https://eve.dwrl.utexas.edu/">UT Digital Writing and Research Lab</a> is using the enterprise version. </li>
<li>CritiqueIt could be used by any instructor that has to give handwritten or digital feedback on text documents, pdfs or Power Point files. The eas of scrolling through a pile of documents and selecting and hilighting text while layering in the variety of types of feedback. The simple fact that you do not have to open each file speeds up the very time consuming process of reading and giving feedback on written work.</li>
<li>Ideally both teachers and students would have access to CritiqueIt I imagine that it is cost prohibitive for the entire population in a seconday public school setting.</li>
<li>If you are giving feedback on a lot of written work and you institution or orgnization can afford it, there is no reason not to start using this tool right away. One of the suggestions during the demo was that you can actually flip the usage and send your foreign language students a document and have them respond with an audio or video demonstrating there proficiency.</li>    </ol>
    </ul>
